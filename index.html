                 <h8>It's been 2 months and 19 days of us being romantically inclined together and they have been the best 80 days i could ever ask for. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                     I'm overwhelmed with a cascade of emotions that have been bubbling within me for the past 80 days â€” a journey that has been nothing short of enchanting. Every moment spent in the warmth of your presence has been a symphony of joy, creating a tapestry of memories that I hold dear.

         In the embrace of your love, even if you are not yet there ughhhhhhhh , I have discovered a happiness that feels like a dream woven into reality. These 80 days with you have been a poetic dance of shared laughter, whispered secrets, and stolen glances, painting the canvas of our romance with vibrant hues of bliss. I find myself swimming in an ocean of emotions, each wave carrying the melody of our shared experiences. 
                <br>
                <br>
Falling in love with you has been a rollercoaster of emotions, simultaneously thrilling and terrifying. It's a journey that has made me confront my vulnerabilities yet has emboldened me with a courage I never knew existed. In your arms, I've found a sanctuary where fears fade away, and love blooms in the most beautiful shades.
                <br>
                <br>
                Now, as we stand on the precipice of time, it feels like the perfect moment to make our connection official. The fluttering butterflies in my stomach are joyous messengers, urging me to express what my heart has been silently whispering for days. So, sweet cheeks, let's make it official, sealing our bond with the promise of forever.

In your arms, I've discovered a sanctuary, a haven where dreams intertwine with reality. Here's to the countless tomorrows we'll share, hand in hand, as we embark on this extraordinary journey of love.
